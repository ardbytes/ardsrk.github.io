Hi! I am Arvind, author of All About Rails. I have been involved in web development using Rails for 10+ years. I love to code and have experience in several programming languages. These days I am writing code mostly in Ruby and Rust. I am intrigued by Mathematics, especially Linear Algebra and Probability Theory. If you want to get in touch with me, at me on [twitter][twitter].
